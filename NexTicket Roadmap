Planned Updates/Changes: 
1.) Admin-Defined Priorities (P1–P4) - Done
    Goal: Admin can manage 4 priority levels and apply them to tickets.
    P1 – Critical, P2 – High, P3 – Normal, P4 – Low
2.) UI Cleanup - WIP
    There are parts of the UI Id like to clean up, for example on the admin side some texts gets cut off
3.) SLA rules per priority (e.g., P1 respond ≤ 1h, resolve ≤ 24h)
    An estimated resolve time based off of the priority assigned to the ticket.
4.) Email-to-ticket intake
    Be able to send an email to make a ticket
5.) Email ticket updates to the subject
    Email the subject of the ticket when the status of their ticket is updated for example when a ticket is closed -> send a email stating the ticket has been closed
6.) Close/Resolve Reason
    When a ticket is closed, add a reason
